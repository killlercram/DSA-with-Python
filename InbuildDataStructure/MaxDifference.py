"""Find Maximum Difference Between Two Consecutive Elements (Brute Force Approach)

You are given a list of integers. Write a Python program to find the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in the list using a brute-force approach. The difference is defined as the absolute value of the difference between two consecutive elements.

Parameters:

lst (List of integers): A list of integers.

Returns:

An integer representing the maximum difference between two consecutive elements.

Example:

Input: lst = [1, 7, 3, 10, 5]
Output: 7

The maximum difference is between 3 and 10 (i.e., |3 - 10| = 7).

Input: lst = [10, 11, 15, 3]
Output: 12

The maximum difference is between 15 and 3 (i.e., |15 - 3| = 12)."""


def max_consecutive_difference(lst):
  if len(lst) < 2:
    return 0
  
  max_diff = float('-inf')
  for i in range(1,len(lst)):
    if lst[i] > lst[i-1]:
      diff = lst[i] - lst[i-1]
    else:
      diff = lst[i-1] - lst[i]

    if diff >= max_diff:
      max_diff = diff

  return max_diff

print(max_consecutive_difference([10, 11, 15, 3]))

# And rather then doing like this we can use abs() methods

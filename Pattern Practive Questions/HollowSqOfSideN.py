Problem Description:

You are given an integer n. Your task is to return a hollow square pattern of size n x n made up of the character '*', represented as a list of strings. The hollow square has '*' on the border, and spaces ' ' in the middle (except for side lengths of 1 and 2).

Input Parameters:

n (int): The size of the square (number of rows and columns).

Output:
